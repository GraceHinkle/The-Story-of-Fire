    <h2>Meet the Fire and its Researchers</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>The Wapiti Burn of 2024</h3>
    <p id="about_me">On July 24th, 2024, lightning struck and caused the fire that would soon be known as Wapiti.
      Located in central Idaho next to Grandjean, it would spread so quickly that by August it had surpassed 70,000 acres,
      Firefighters had almost none of it contained, and parts of Stanley had been evacuated. Because of the fires intensity 
      and mountainous terrain it was burning within the Sawtooths, efforts to suppress the fire quickly change to solely 
      focusing on containing it and making sure it didn't spread further. It would burn through nearly 130,000 acres and
      take several fire and wildlife departments getting involved before it would eventually die sometime in late November.
      However, the Story of Fire does not end there...
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>What is "The Story of Fire"?</h3>
    <p id="about_me">Fires story starts with its burn, the life of the fire itself from its spark to its last embers. 
      However, just like how every person has a story that intertwines with others, fire makes significant impacts on the lives and 
      stories of those around it. From the people of Stanley and Grandjean lodge who had to be evacuated, who are lucky enough
      to be able to tell their stories about how the fire changed their lives, to the actual land it burned, something that tells its story 
      in a much more visual way. In order to truly understand a fire, must look at how the land around it reacted to it and how 
      it is recovering a year later. In the specific case of Wapiti, heavy rain would follow close after the burns end, adding many new affects 
      and layers to the story, including debris flows.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Our goal</h3>
    <p id="about_me">GEOS 497 is a semester long class at BSU taught by Jen Pierce dedicated to having students from
      different fields come together to learn about how wildfires in the western US affect the land. Our primary
      focus is learning about fires  and debris flows through studying the Wapiti fire that burned in the Sawtooths of Idaho in 2024. We 
      have been given a great opportunity to do first hand feild research on a wildfire relatively local to us that has also caused debris flows.
      Over this semester we each have been doing our own research on a variety of topics, hoping that once it all comes together we can help answer 
      some of our own questions about the Story of Fire. 
    </p>
       <p id="about_me">If you'd like to learn more about the fire and our research on it, please look at our projects on the next few pages.</p>
